# Propaganda-Detection

We aim to solve all subtasks in the SemEval 2021 Task 6 on "Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Texts and Images". 

All information about the task can be found on the task [page](https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2021task6/index.html) and [repository](https://github.com/di-dimitrov/SEMEVAL-2021-task6-corpus).

A detailed description of our solution can be found, as well as the results, on the project report in this repository.

## DATASETS

The datasets used for the project can be found at these links:
* [Subtasks data](https://github.com/di-dimitrov/SEMEVAL-2021-task6-corpus/tree/main/data)
* [Twitter 2020 Elections Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets) used for BERT training

## INFO AND CREDITS

This is a project made for the course "Deep Learning" by Riccardo Vella and Giuseppe Spina. 

It is written in Colab and not intended to run by cloning the repository. This code is intended to run by connecting to a personal Google Drive, where there should be a folder called "Deep Learning", containing the Datasets.
